# hall_sensor_array
## Introduction
  The goal of this project is to create a large array of hall effect sensors, record the output of each sensor using a esp32 microcontroller and forward it to a computer for further post processing and long term storage.

## Sensors
  I am using a array of 256 sensors paired with a small capacitor connected between output and GND. The sensor used is AH49HSC. 
## Disclamer
  This is a work in progress. No circuit has been tested and I cant guarantee they work.
